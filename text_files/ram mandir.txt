Rama, considered an incarnation of god Vishnu, is a widely worshiped Hindu deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya. This became known as Ram Janmabhoomi or Ram's birthplace. In the 15th century, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid, on Ram Janmabhoomi. Hindus believe that the mosque was built after razing a Hindu temple. It was only in the 1850s when the dispute surfaced in a violent form and in December 1992 the demolition of the Babri Masjid took place. Various title and legal disputes also took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Ordinance, 1993. It was only after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya dispute that it was decided the disputed land be handed over to a trust formed by the Government. The trust formed was Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.[4] On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the parliament that the Union Council of Ministers had accepted a scheme to construct the temple.[5]
